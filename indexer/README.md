# Blockchain indexer

It uses [thegraph](https://thegraph.com)

**Deploy**

```bash
npm run codegen
npm run deploy:ropsten # or deploy:mainnet
```

If a new collection in Ethereum is added you will need to add it as following

```
npx ts-node scripts/importWearableCollection.ts --collection ../../wearable-api/data/collections/{collection_name}/index.json > src/data/wearables/{collection_name}.ts
```

checkout the docs https://thegraph.com/docs/quick-start

### Queries

The collection's `id` is the smart contract address of the collection.
The item's `id` is `{collection_contract_address}-{item_blochain_id}`. The `item_blockchain_id` is the index of the item in the collection. E.g: if you have a collection with 2 items, the first is `0` and the second one is `1`. Therefore, the id of the first item will be: `{contract_address}-0`

Ethereum addresses should be passed lowercased:

- `0xB549B2442b2BD0a53795BC5cDcBFE0cAF7ACA9f8` ❌
- `0xb549b2442b2bd0a53795bc5cdcbfe0caf7aca9f8` ✅
